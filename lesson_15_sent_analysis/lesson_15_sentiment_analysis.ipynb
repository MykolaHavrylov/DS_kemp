      "which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . \n",
      "they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \n",
      "so what are the problems with the movie ? \n",
      "well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . \n",
      "it starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . \n",
      "there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \n",
      "now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . \n",
      "it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \n",
      "and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \n",
      "not really . \n",
      "the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . \n",
      "i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \n",
      "i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \n",
      "okay , we get it . . . there \n",
      "are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . \n",
      "do we really need to see it over and over again ? \n",
      "how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \n",
      "apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \n",
      "there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \n",
      "the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \n",
      "but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . \n",
      "overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \n",
      "oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's \n",

    "new_review = '''This unusual satire on gangsters and revenge stories, starts off with a quote from Oscar Wilde and some delightful background music that sets the tone for rest of the film. The first few minutes play out like a predictable thriller, featuring a wronged father and his pursuit for vigilante justice. But, what follows is a series of stylised killing sequences, that almost seem like parodies of action set pieces that you’ve seen Liam Neeson pulling off with deadpan ease in the past. Yet, director Hans Petter Noland, who also made the Norwegian film In Order Of Disappearance that inspired Cold Pursuit, and writer Frank Baldwin create a refreshing narrative full of memorable moments. The movie seems bizarrely funny and the snow-heavy setting creates the right atmosphere for the dry and cold-cut humour.\r\n",
    "The story begins with tragedy and the first few minutes seem dead serious, right up to the point where Coxman confronts his first victim, the gangster named Speedo. But, as the revenge-seeking father moves up the ranks of the mafia chain, the characters become quirky and the situations get thoroughly entertaining. The introduction of characters like Viking (Tom Bateman), the main antagonist and his team of crazy henchmen like Mustang, Dexter and more, alleviates the narrative. There’s also a track of warring mafia gangs as Viking wages a war against the native Indians led by White Bull (Tom Jackson). Cold Pursuit may not be too creative with the kill sequences, but it does get interesting with the wry sense of humour.\r\n",
    "Neeson does what he does best. He keeps a straight face and plays the game of intimidation with ease. He’s just a regular guy who’s way out of his league, killing gangsters. But, his outrageous mission is what makes the story interesting. Watch out for a superb cameo by William Forsythe, too, who plays a brief but key role in Coxman’s revenge saga.\r\n",
    "The way Cold Pursuit manages to blend sardonic humour with cold-blooded killings makes it reminiscent of movies like The Coen Brothers’ Fargo and Guy Ritchie’s Snatch. This one’s a refreshingly cool black-comedy that does wonders for the genre.\r\n",
